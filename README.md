# ASCII2NUM
This is a series of scripts in different languages made specifically for getting the ASCII code of a character.

This repository is intended to be the most cross-platform possible, so testing on another operating systems rather than GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac is the objective (Excepting the languages that aren't compatible)

Also, apart from cross-platforming, the goal of this project is to have the biggest database of ASCII2NUM's possible. If you know any language that hasn't been shown, please contribute!
